# BusAsM
AM radio data exfiltration with a system bus in assembly

To put it in a nutshell, my solution was:
* More simple (few lines in assembly and some Python scripts)
* More robust (written in assembly)
* More reliable (less collisions)
* Cross-platform (Linux/Windows/BSD)
* Hardware-independent (32/64-bit/ARM)
* Software-independent (no dependencies whatsoever, except Python for the PoC)
